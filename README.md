## Modifications

Modifications are listed in the source code of this python package, which can be found [here](/src/IGC2CSV_modified/IGC2CSV.py). Please note that the `IGC2CSV` class is encorporated as an external package in the `flight-analyzer` application, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/nicolashuberIT/flight-analyzer). Both the modifications as well as the unit testing of this package are meant to make sure that the output of the `IGC2CSV` utility matches the requirements of the `flight-analyzer` tool and its algorithms.
